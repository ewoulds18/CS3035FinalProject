# CS3035 â€“ Course Project Description

## Description of Your Project

Below, provide a short description of what your project is, how it works, and why you selected this as your project.

For my project I made a drawing application. The different operations that you can perform are drawing freely, drawing
a rectangle, drawing a circle, adding text, erasing anything in the canvas, an undo button, a redo button, color 
selector for border and fill and a width slider to change sizes of the lines. To use the application you select one of 
the drawing options from the toolbar (you can change te size of lines with the slider and border and line color with 
color pickers) and then right-click the canvas to start drawing. If you want to clear the canvas click file->clear 
or if you're all done and want to save your image click file->save. You can open it later by going to file->open.
I chose this for my project because I saw it as a way to apply some stuff that we completed in the assignments such 
as drawing shapes and then also extending what we learned from the assignments and applying some new things 
such as the undo/redo options.

## Requirements

- **How/What different views did you provide for some aspect of your model?**

My main view is the first screen when running the application which contains the menu bar, custom toolbar and the 
canvas. For other views I have the about me and help view that can be found in the menu bar under the help tab.

- **What custom widget did you create in your application?**

The custom widget for my project is the toolbar. It contains all the buttons to select what you would like to draw and 
the different sizes and colors as well as undo and redo

- **What are the different domain objects that can be created/edited in 
your application?**

The domain objects are the different objects that you can draw. Any of the objects you can draw can 
then be full or partial erased as well as the shapes can be undone and redone.
 
- **What parts of the application/project did you find particularly challenging? 
And, what would you have liked to improve?**

The hardest part of this project was trying to get the undo and redo working properly. I had a lot of issues with it 
initially and had to do a good bit of research into figuring it out. The main thing that I would have liked to improve
is the undo and redo. I would have like to get it to work for not only the shapes but the text and free draw lines as
well.

- **Any  other comments on the course project?**

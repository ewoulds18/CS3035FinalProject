# CS3035 â€“ Course Project Description

## Description of Your Project

Below, provide a short description of what your project is, how it works, and why you selected this as your project.



## Requirements

- **How/What different views did you provide for some aspect of your model?**

My main view is the first screen when running the application which contains the menu bar, custom toolbar and the 
canvas. For other views I have the about me and help view that can be found in the menu bar under the help tab.

- **What custom widget did you create in your application?**

The custom widget for my project is the toolbar. It contains all the buttons to select what you would like to draw and 
the different sizes and colors as well as undo and redo

- **What are the different domain objects that can be created/edited in 
your application?**

The domain objects are the different objects that you can draw. Any of the objects you can draw can 
then be full or partial erased as well as the shapes can be undone and redone.
 
- **What parts of the application/project did you find particularly challenging? 
And, what would you have liked to improve?**

The hardest part of this project was trying to get the undo and redo working properly. I had a lot of issues with it 
initially and had to do a good bit of research into figuring it out. The main thing that I would have liked to improve
is the undo and redo. I would have like to get it to work for not only the shapes but the text and free draw lines as
well.

- **Any  other comments on the course project?**
